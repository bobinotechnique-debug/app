# Phase 0 - Step 000: Repository reset and indexing

Status: Complete

## Objective
Establish the Phase 0 scaffolding: repository directories, baseline indexes, roadmap entry, and guard placeholders with no business logic.

## Scope
- Create required directories from the root navigation map.
- Add initial INDEX files to document Phase 0 structure.
- Ensure README points to AGENT.md as the single source of truth.
- Keep content ASCII-only and free of Phase 1 references.

## Deliverables
- Directories for backend, frontend, docs, specs, api, ux, ops, roadmap, PS1, scripts, tools/guards, and CI workflows.
- INDEX files in docs/ and top-level folders reflecting Phase 0 scope.
- Roadmap index entries for Phase 0 and this step.
- CHANGELOG entry capturing the reset.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing business logic or Phase 1+ planning.
- Defining API/UX behavior beyond placeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All required directories exist with placeholders to keep them under version control.
- README highlights AGENT.md as authoritative.
- Roadmap and indexes clearly state Phase 0-only scope.
- No violations of ASCII-only or Phase 1 reference rules.

## Validation
- Repository directories now include .github/workflows, PS1, scripts, and tools/guards with tracked placeholders.
- README and indexes point to AGENT.md and Phase 0 scope only.
- All content remains ASCII-only and avoids Phase 1 references.
