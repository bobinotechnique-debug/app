# Guard Scripts Placeholder

Phase 0 requires guard entry points but defers implementation. Scripts will enforce ASCII, roadmap binding, and scope checks.

- Guard scope: repository-wide safety rules per [AGENT.md](../../AGENT.md).
- Status: placeholders only; logic to be added in later steps.
- Roadmap: [roadmap/phase-0/step-000.md](../../roadmap/phase-0/step-000.md)
