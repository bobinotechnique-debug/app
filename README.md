# Project Reset - Phase 0

This repository is in **Phase 0**. The only authoritative contract is [AGENT.md](AGENT.md). Refer to it before any change.

## Scope
Phase 0 establishes governance, repository layout, tooling placeholders, and smoke-test scaffolding only. No business logic or future-phase planning is permitted.

## Navigation
- Governance: [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)
- Roadmap: [roadmap/INDEX.md](roadmap/INDEX.md)
- Documentation indexes: [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md), [specs/INDEX.md](specs/INDEX.md), [api/INDEX.md](api/INDEX.md), [ux/INDEX.md](ux/INDEX.md), [ops/INDEX.md](ops/INDEX.md)
- CI/CD and guards: [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/) and [tools/guards/](tools/guards/)

## Phase 0 guardrails
- ASCII-only content.
- Stop immediately on any guard or CI failure.
- No references to Phase 1 or later until Phase 0 is sealed.
- All changes must map to a roadmap step; Phase 0 tracking starts at [roadmap/phase-0/step-000.md](roadmap/phase-0/step-000.md).
