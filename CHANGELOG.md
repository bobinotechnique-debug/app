# Changelog

All notable changes are tracked here. Phase 0 entries must reference roadmap steps and remain ASCII-only.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Phase 0 scaffolding per [roadmap/phase-0/step-000](roadmap/phase-0/step-000.md): established repository structure, initial indexes, and guard placeholders.
- Placeholder PowerShell scripts, guard notes, and workflow directory tracked for Phase 0 validation.
- Validation completed for Phase 0 step 000 with directory, index, and ASCII-only checks recorded.
- Workflow stubs and guard stop notes aligned to Phase 0 stop conditions to keep CI non-executable until hardening.
- Phase 1 implementation readiness audit refined to capture roadmap/spec/UX/API gaps and document a NOT READY verdict pending roadmap and specs.
- Phase 1 roadmap foundation recorded with planning goals, domain entities, and stop conditions in [docs/roadmap/phase1/step-01-planning-core.md](docs/roadmap/phase1/step-01-planning-core.md) and indexed via [docs/roadmap/phase1/INDEX.md](docs/roadmap/phase1/INDEX.md).
- Phase 1 step 01 expanded with explicit scope, deliverables, traceability requirements, and validation steps to enforce planning-only boundaries before implementation.
