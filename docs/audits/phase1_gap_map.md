# Phase 1 Gap Map (Planning-Only)

## Declared but Unused Concepts
- None. Draft/Validated/Frozen planning_state values are now documented as a compatibility overlay derived from Specs Step 12 entity lifecycles.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L16-L149】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L16-L199】

## Used but Undefined Concepts
- None. Active/closed/locked and related lifecycle states are explicitly incorporated into the planning_state derivation matrix in API Step 07.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L16-L149】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L63-L178】

## Misplaced Phase 1 Concepts
- None. Organization lifecycle governance is now explicitly called out as lifecycle-driven (active/archived) outside of planning_state transitions.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L16-L53】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L65-L83】
