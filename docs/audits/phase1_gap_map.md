# Phase 1 Gap Map (Planning-Only)

## Declared but Unused Concepts
- None. Draft/Validated/Frozen planning_state values are documented as a compatibility overlay derived from Specs Step 12 entity lifecycles per DEC-P1-LIFECYCLE-001.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L1-L120】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L16-L199】【F:docs/decisions/decision_phase1_lifecycle_authority.md†L1-L23】

## Used but Undefined Concepts
- None. Active/closed/locked and related lifecycle states are explicitly incorporated into the planning_state derivation summary and per-entity mapping in API Step 07.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L25-L120】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L63-L178】

## Misplaced Phase 1 Concepts
- None. Organization lifecycle governance is explicitly called out as lifecycle-driven (active/archived) outside of planning_state transitions, with Specs Step 12 as the authority.【F:docs/api/phase1/step-07-planning-state-transitions.md†L13-L53】【F:docs/specs/phase1/step-12-planning-lifecycle-and-state-transitions.md†L65-L83】【F:docs/decisions/decision_phase1_lifecycle_authority.md†L1-L23】
