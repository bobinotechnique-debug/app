- [Step 01 - Planning Core](step-01-planning-core.md)
- Status: Approved
- Purpose: Set the planning baseline and domain vocabulary before any Phase 1 design or development begins.
- Deliverables:
  - Phase 1 roadmap entry referencing the planning core contract.
  - Documented goals, non-goals, and domain entities for planning governance.
  - Stop conditions blocking backend, frontend, or ops work until planning is approved.
  - Validation checklist and self-audit cues to enforce readiness gates with recorded approval in the readiness audit.
- Acceptance:
  - Planning-only scope is explicit with traceability to Phase 1 artifacts.
  - Domain entity definitions and planning invariant are recorded and referenced.
  - Roadmap linkage enables downstream specs, UX, and API work to trace to this step.
  - Readiness and audit steps are documented so dependent specs, UX, and API authors can reference approvals and proceed.
