- Purpose: Set the planning baseline and domain vocabulary before any Phase 1 design or development begins.
- Deliverables:
  - Phase 1 roadmap entry referencing the planning core contract.
  - Documented goals, non-goals, and domain entities for planning governance.
  - Stop conditions blocking backend, frontend, or ops work until planning is approved.
- Acceptance:
  - Planning-only scope is explicit with traceability to Phase 1 artifacts.
  - Domain entity definitions and planning invariant are recorded and referenced.
  - Roadmap linkage enables downstream specs, UX, and API work to trace to this step.
