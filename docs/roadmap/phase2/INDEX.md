# Phase 2 - Roadmap Index
Status: In Progress

## Step 02 - Architecture Lock
- [Step 02 - Architecture Lock](step-02-architecture-lock.md)
- Status: Done
- Purpose: Lock backend, frontend, data, and system-flow architecture for Phase 2 implementation readiness.
- Dependencies: Requires adherence to Phase 1 contracts and the locked error envelope from Phase 1 Step 10.
- Any deviation from the architecture contracts requires a DECISION doc under docs/decisions/.

## Step 03 - Bootstrap Skeletons
- [Step 03 - Bootstrap Skeletons](step-03-bootstrap-skeletons.md)
- Status: Pending
- Purpose: Wire backend and frontend skeletons that align to the Step 02 architecture lock without adding business logic.
- Dependencies: Must follow Step 02 architecture boundaries and Phase 1 locks.

## Next Authorized Step
- Step 03: [Bootstrap Skeletons](step-03-bootstrap-skeletons.md)
