# Phase 2 - Roadmap Index
Status: In Progress

## Step 02 - Architecture Lock
- [Step 02 - Architecture Lock](step-02-architecture-lock.md)
- Status: Done
- Purpose: Lock backend, frontend, data, and system-flow architecture for Phase 2 implementation readiness.
- Dependencies: Requires adherence to Phase 1 contracts and the locked error envelope from Phase 1 Step 10.
- Any deviation from the architecture contracts requires a DECISION doc under docs/decisions/.

## Next Authorized Step
- Step 03: Pending definition (must align with the locked architecture and Phase 1 scopes before activation).
