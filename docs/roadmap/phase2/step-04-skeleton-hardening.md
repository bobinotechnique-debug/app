# Phase 2 - Step 04: Skeleton Hardening
Status: Pending

## Purpose
- Harden the bootstrap skeletons with additional technical guards without introducing business behavior.
- Prepare the scaffolds for upcoming domain implementations while respecting architecture locks.

## Scope
- Evaluate and strengthen wiring, observability hooks, and dependency boundaries defined in earlier steps.
- Keep domain rules and product semantics out of scope until explicitly authorized.

## Next Authorized Step
- To be confirmed after Step 04 completion.
