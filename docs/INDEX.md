# Documentation Index

Phase 0 documentation structure (locked for governance history):
- [Roadmap](roadmap/INDEX.md)
- [Architecture](architecture/INDEX.md)
- [Specifications](specs/INDEX.md)
- [API](api/INDEX.md)
- [UX](ux/INDEX.md)
- [Operations](ops/INDEX.md)

Additional audit records:
- [Phase 0 implementation readiness audit](audits/implementation_readiness.md)
- [Phase 1 implementation readiness audit](audits/implementation_readiness_phase1.md)
- [Phase 1 planning audit](audits/phase1_audit.md)
- [Phase 1 gap map](audits/phase1_gap_map.md)

All documents must remain ASCII-only. Phase 1 references are restricted to readiness and roadmap preparation; implementation requires Phase 1 roadmap and specs to be in place.
Any deviation from locked architecture requires a DECISION doc under docs/decisions/.
